# weather-app
Designed and developed a minimal weather app which shows the temperature of your current location using geolocation.

For weather Data I have used OpenWeather API.

live demo - https://aayushg02.github.io/weather-app/

p.s - you can click on the temperature value to convert it into fahrenheit and vice-versa
